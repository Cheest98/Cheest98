👋 **Hi there, I'm Łukasz!**

🎓 **About Me**: I'm a Systems Engineer with a passion for programming and technology. I hold both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Systems Engineering. My academic journey was marked by numerous projects ranging from Python applications, such as a heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with a graphical UI, to developing web applications.

👨‍💻 **Engineering Projects**: My Bachelor's thesis focused on creating a web application for managing student groups, featuring functionalities like grouping users, adding posts , assigning tasks, creating shopping lists, and integrating a shared group calendar. This project utilized Django and React, showcasing my ability to blend backend and frontend technologies seamlessly.

For my Master's thesis, I embarked on a comparative study of Single Page Application technologies - Angular vs. React. This involved building simple applications with each, analyzing their performance, conducting unit tests, and proposing optimizations.

🚀 **Professional Path**: My IT career kicked off with an internship where, as part of a duo, I developed a WCAG-compliant website and a quiz mobile app for internal training purposes. Post-internship, I joined a startup platform for game key sellers, quickly ascending to the role of Customer Service Team Leader, managing a team of ten.

🌱 **Currently**: Beyond my day job, I'm deeply immersed in programming with React, TypeScript, and Next.js, continuously working on personal projects and honing my skills.

📚 **Focus**: I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in web development, particularly in creating efficient, user-friendly applications. My GitHub is a canvas for my experiments, learnings, and projects that I've embarked on throughout my journey in tech.
